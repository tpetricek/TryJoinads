    <h1>Introducing Try Joinads</h1>

<p>Welcome to Try Joinads!</p>

<p>This web site is an interactive tutorial that introduces <em>joinads</em> - a research extension of the F# language.
The tutorial presents several uses of the extension. It focuses on concurrent, parallel and asynchronous
programming, but it also shows several examples from other domains, including parsers and option values.
Aside from uses of <em>joinads</em>, there are also several sections that discuss how to implement joinads for other
types of values or computations.</p>

<p>The tutorial uses an Interactive F# console hosted in a web browser using <a href="http://www.silverlight.net/" title="Silverlight homepage">Silverlight</a> (Windows or Mac) or 
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/moonlight/" title="Moonlight homepage">Moonlight</a> (Linux), so you can run the tutorials in your browser and experiment on your own. The console is based
on an <a href="http://fsharppowerpack.codeplex.com/" title="Open-source release of F#">open-source release</a> of the F# compiler. A research implementation of the F# compiler that implements
joinads is <a href="https://github.com/tpetricek/FSharp.Extensions" title="F# Extensions Source Code">also available</a>.</p>

<p>If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the tutorials, or if you have another interesting implementation
of joinads or an extension of the F# compiler that could be added, please get in touch: <a href="tomas@tomasp.net">tomas@tomasp.net</a> or

<h2>Table of contents</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>The following article is the best place to start if you haven't seen joinads before.
It shows a basic example and includes links to other resources.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="intro.html"><strong>Introduction</strong></a> shows a
basic example of parallel programming with joinads in F# and provides a
general overview of the concept, as well as basic Haskell example.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="pubs.html"><strong>Publications</strong></a> provides
links to academic publications related to joinads. These contain more details about
<em>joinad</em> as an algebraic structure and about the language feature design.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Programming with joinads</h3>

<p>The following articles show several examples of using joinads for concurrent, parallel 
and reactive programming. They use an implementation of joinad operations that is available
in standard joinads library.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="use/async.html"><strong>Asynchronous workflows and joinads</strong></a>
shows how to use joinads in asynchronous programming. Applications include asynchronously waiting
for multiple computations or waiting for the first computation that produces certain value.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="use/tasks.html"><strong>Task-based parallelism</strong></a>
has been already demonstrated in the <a href="intro.html">introduction</a>. This tutorial
shows a more complete example that uses joinads for recursive tree processing with
short-circuiting.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="use/agents.html"><strong>Agent-based programming</strong></a>
can benefit from the notation used by joinads when implementing agent (<code>MailboxProcessor</code>) that
uses the <code>Scan</code> method. This tutorial shows several examples.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="use/joins.html"><strong>Concurrent programming using joins</strong></a> 
shows a library that uses joinads to embed <em>join calculus</em> in F#. The library can be used for
writing concurrent primitives, such as blocking collection and others.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Implementing joinads</h3>

<p>The following articles briefly explain how to implement joinads for several standard types
of computations including <code>option</code> values and F# asynchronous workflows.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="implement/options.html"><strong>Programming with option values</strong></a>
shows the implementation of joinad computation builder for the <code>option&lt;'T&gt;</code> type. The sample
uses parallel <em>composition</em> and <em>choice</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="implement/parsers.html"><strong>Writing parsers with joinads</strong></a>
shows that joinads are useful in areas other than just concurrent and parallel programming.
For parsers, joinads make it possible to express the <em>intersection of languages</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="implement/async.html"><strong>Joinads for asynchronous workflows</strong></a>
explains how to add joinad operations to the <code>Async&lt;'T&gt;</code> type. The sample also provides more
details on how aliasing is used in joinads.</p></li>
</ul>
